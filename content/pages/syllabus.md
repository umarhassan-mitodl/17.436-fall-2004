Course Description
------------------

This graduate seminar introduces an emerging research program within International Relations on territorial conflict. While scholars have recognized that territory has been one of the most frequent issues over which states go to war, territorial conflicts have only recently become the subject of systematic study. This course will examine why territorial conflicts arise in the first place, why some of these conflicts escalate to high levels of violence and why other territorial disputes reach settlement, thereby reducing the likelihood of war. Readings in the course draw upon political geography and history as well as qualitative and quantitative approaches to political science. Undergraduates may enroll with the instructor's permission.

Requirements
------------

The main requirement for this seminar is a research paper on a topic to be agreed upon in consultation with the instructor. As a seminar, the other requirement for this course is to participate in class discussion. The success of any seminar depends on the degree to which members of the seminar prepare readings in advance and actively participate in the discussion. Depending on the size of the course, participants may be asked to serve as discussion leaders.
